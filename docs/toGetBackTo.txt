everybody can see user data -> maybe create a VIEW 
    so that only certain data is visible
everybody can create a Project and add/rmv users to project
after modifying a project (adminPanel) only the changed project should be refetched
when creating a proj. admin should be included by default
not that happy with error handling UI 
make composables type safe
should I keep the logic that is used only once in a page into composables?
